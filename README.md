# College-Gender-Visualisation
The project contains a basic visualization of gender participation in various degree categories. 

The following project aims to do basic visualization of data from the American Community Survey on University Graduates focusing on the gender distribution over time.
The Directory files are as follows:

1. "College Earnings.csv" contains the original data file from FiveThirtyEight
2. "College Gender Visualization Project.ipynb" contains the Jupyter norebook with all the workings and the visualisation workflow of the data.
3. "gender_degrees.png" contains the finakl output file from the notebook, which is the image of gender distribution of categorised degrees over time.
